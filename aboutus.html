              <p>Accuracy was founded in 2002 by two accountants, William Manners and Sanjay Kumar. The two met in college while studying finance at Northeastern University. After years of industry experience, Bill and Sanjay decided to “put their friendship to a test” and start an accounting firm together. When they created Accuracy, the two knew that they wanted customer service to be their main priority. They also set a precedent of having a positive impact on the community. Bill and Sanjay retired in 2010 and 2012 (respectively), but their legacy lives on at Accuracy. Today we make sure to make our customer’s aspirations our own, and every year Accuracy donates a portion of profits to community efforts. Past projects have included funding for schools, parks and after school programs to encourage underrepresented and economically challenged children to pursue careers in Business. Accuracy is proud of the work we have done for our customers, but we are even more proud about the impact we have had on our community, and look forward to encouraging the next generation of business leaders.</p>
